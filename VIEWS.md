# Sample Views
This template project features a number of sample views that can be used as starting points for the content of your application.

## Main Menu Sample

This template project features a sample of a Sidebar-style main menu which can be accessed throughout the app. This is done by leveraging Xamarin's [MasterDetailPage](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/navigation/master-detail-page/) to provide a consistent menu page and a custom Navigation Service (detailed in the *Dependency Injection and Services* section) to change the focused page.

### Master/Detail Page

In the `App.cs` file which defines the core Xamarin Forms application, you can see that we set the MainPage of the application to an instance of our custom MasterDetailWrapper class.

`MasterDetailWrapper.cs` extends Xamarin Form's MasterDetailPage class and builds up the page to feature our Main Menu Page as the "Master" page (aka the pull-out menu) and our Landing Page as the "Detail" page (aka the page being viewed.)
